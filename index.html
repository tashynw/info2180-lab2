                    <h2>Taking Breaks While Studying</h2>
                    <h4>September 28, 2022 by Andre Bryan</h4>

                    <p>When you are working or studying hard, your brain has to resist distractions in order to focus on the task at hand. Your prefrontal cortex is mostly responsible for this kind of “think-work” as it plays a major role in your ability to concentrate, think logically, and resist uimpulses. This level of concentration gets harder by the minute as your brain expends energy! At some point, you will need to recharge in order to replenish after working so hard.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, while it may seem counterintuitive, taking regular breaks can actually help you be more productive than working without stopping. Effective breaks can help to reduce your stress levels so that you’re ready to re-focus when you return to your work. Taking breaks while studying can even improve recall! If you find yourself growing increasingly frustrated or stalled on a certain task despite your efforts, this may be a sign that it’s time to rest your brain and take a break.</p>

                    <h2>How to Study Effectively</h2>

                    <p>Sit down and make a list of what you think will be on an exam or quiz. Next, write down all the resources you have at your disposal to help you learn the information, such as taking a practice exam or joining a study group.Once you figure out what you need to study and how you will take advantage of the resources at your disposal, sit down and make a study schedule. Block out periods of time within your schedule to dedicate to studying and stick to the plan.</p>
                    <p>You need to be in as positive a mindset as possible when you sit down to study. If you are emotionally distracted, you will be less effective at learning and retaining information. Try to think positively while studying, and don’t compare yourself to others. Where you study affects how effective your study sessions are. If you are distracted by television, the Internet, or your roommate, you won’t study as effectively as you would in a quiet place with fewer distractions.</p>
